# Unreal OBS Captions

An Unreal Engine plugin for sending the captions to OBS streams by using [obs-websocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket). Built for Windows, Linux, And MacOs

## IMPORTANT

- Unreal Engine by default has the subtitle system disable itself if something else hooks into it

## Use

Hopefully you should be able add to your plugin folder in a UE project and it will just work

## Roadmap

1. Add authentication support
2. Implement slightly custom subtitle rendering
3. Add options menu support
4. Add support for custom subtitle systems
5. Update logo
